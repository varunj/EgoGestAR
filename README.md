# **EgoGestAR** *(ego-gesture)*
An egocentric pointing gesture dataset.

Public Testing Dataset: https://github.com/varunj/EgoGestAR/tree/master/testvideo


# The Gestures
- The left column shows standard input gesture sequences shown to the users before the data collection.
- The right column depicts the variation in the data samples.

These gestures could be applied to different use cases. 
- The black block depicts swipe gestures (Left, Right, Up, Down) for list interaction.
- Green block showing Rectangle and Circle gestures for Region of Interest (RoI) highlighting.
- Red block (Checkmark: Yes, Caret: No, X: Delete, Star: Bookmark) gestures for evidence capture (in, say, industrial AR applications.)


*The highlighted point in each gesture indicates the starting position of the gesture.*

# Usage

## testvideo/
- Lists 240 gesture videos captured in varying environments, lighting conditions and by various users. 
- 22 videos per class and additional 20 random hand movement videos.
- File naming convention: testvideo\_*gesturename*\_*serialnumber*.mp4 

## test/
- Lists 500 gesture inputs used for testing. 50 gestures per class.
- File naming convention: test\_*gesturename*\_*serialnumber*.txt 

## test_images/
- Lists 500 gesture images corresponding to the inputs. Plotted in black and white with a circular dot representing the starting of the gesture. 
- File naming convention: test\_*gesturename*\_*serialnumber*.png

## test_time/
- Lists the time taken (in seconds) to perform each test gesture.

## train/
- Lists 2000 gesture inputs used for training. 200 gestures per class.
- File naming convention: train\_*gesturename*\_*serialnumber*.txt 

## train_images/
- Lists 2000 gesture images corresponding to the inputs. Plotted in black and white with a circular dot representing the starting of the gesture. 
- File naming convention: train\_*gesturename*\_*serialnumber*.png 

## train_time/
- Lists the time taken (in seconds) to perform each training gesture.


# Codebase

## 1make_grnd_perfect.py
1. Run to generate ground truth files for gestures.

## 1make_grnd_gesture.py
1. Run to generate ground truth for custom gestures and corresponding time taken to draw each gesture.
2. Gestures saved in train_.txt separated by '----------'.

## 2display_files.py, 2display_files_combine.py
1. Reads from the specified folder.
2. Generates a graphical representation of the gestures in 10 graphs (to interpret the gesture).

## 3generate_dtw_results_realtime.py
1. Accepts the input gesture during runtime.
2. Outputs as above in <4generate_results>.

## 4train_raw_process.py
1. Reads '-----------' separated gestures and stores as different files.

## 5histogram_stats.py
1. Outputs a histogram of the length of raw gestures captured.

## 6resample_to_200.py
1. Up/Down samples raw gestures to 200 length.

## Note
1. Requires Kivy (https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html)
